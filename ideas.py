i.e., wealth employed in the production of goods and services for sale.
This wealth is the foundation both of
the supply of products that people buy
and of the demand for the labor that people sell.
The greater the wealth of the capitalists, the higher are real wages,
both because of a more abundant supply of products produced
and a greater demand for the labor of wage earners.
Diverting funds used to purchase capital goods and pay wages into spending for consumers goods,
which is the effect of virtually all taxation that falls on the rich,
and also of government borrowing,
reduces both the demand for and production of capital goods and the demand for labor.
In other words, it serves to hold down production, keep up prices, and hold down wages. """
